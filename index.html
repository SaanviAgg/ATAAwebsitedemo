      <h3>FORGE 4421 - FRC</h3>
      <p>
        At Forge Robotics, FRC Team 4421, our students are driven by the core
        values of FIRST — innovation, teamwork, and a commitment to learning.
        Both on and off the field, we strive to grow as individuals and as a
        team, empowering each other to think creatively, act with integrity,
        and lead with purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        Forge Robotics provides students with the opportunity to explore
        science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) in meaningful,
        hands-on ways throughout the year. Our team is made up of dedicated,
        skilled, and passionate members who push themselves and one another to
        continually improve. We believe that true innovation comes from a
        mindset of resilience — one that embraces challenges, learns from
        failure, and is always ready to try again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the past few seasons, our hard work has paid off. In 2023, we
        ranked within the top 22% of FRC teams globally. By 2024, we climbed
        into the top 10% worldwide. That same year, we also rose from the top
        22% of Canadian teams to an impressive 11%, marking a significant leap
        in our national performance.

      <h3>FTC Teams</h3>
      <p>
        In 2019, the Alberta Tech Alliance Association (ATAA) launched its
        first-ever FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) teams, designed to engage
        students in grades 7 to 9. FTC offers a hands-on robotics experience
        using smaller robots on a 12-by-12-foot playing field, creating an
        accessible and exciting introduction to competitive robotics. The
        program serves as a stepping stone to the more advanced FIRST Robotics
        Competition (FRC), allowing younger students to build foundational STEM
        and teamwork skills. Today, our FTC program includes four dynamic
        teams: HyperDroid #10015, Crazy Artificial Intelligence #16596,
        Uncivilized Mecha Monkeys #23468, and Tech Titans #23684.

      <h3>FLL Teams</h3>
      <p>
        The Alberta Tech Alliance Association (ATAA) also supports three FIRST
        LEGO League (FLL) teams for elementary school students: Fire Breathing
        Rubber Duckies #13487, BOB Bots #58560, and The Creators #62273. FLL is
        the most accessible of the FIRST robotics programs, using LEGO Spike
        Prime robot kits on a tabletop field to introduce young students to the
        fundamentals of engineering, problem-solving, and teamwork in a fun and
        approachable way.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the 2024 season, our FLL teams achieved outstanding success —
        earning awards such as the Core Values Award, Coach of the Year, and
        the Southern Alberta Inspire Award. Their hard work and creativity also
        earned them spots at both the Southern Alberta Championships and the
        Alberta Provincial Championships, showcasing the strength of our
        youngest innovators.
