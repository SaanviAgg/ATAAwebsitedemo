    <h3>FORGE 4421 - FRC</h3>
    <p>
      At Forge Robotics, FRC Team 4421, our students are driven by the core
      values of FIRST — innovation, teamwork, and a commitment to learning.
      Both on and off the field, we strive to grow as individuals and as a
      team, empowering each other to think creatively, act with integrity,
      and lead with purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Forge Robotics provides students with the opportunity to explore
      science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) in meaningful,
      hands-on ways throughout the year. Our team is made up of dedicated,
      skilled, and passionate members who push themselves and one another to
      continually improve. We believe that true innovation comes from a
      mindset of resilience — one that embraces challenges, learns from
      failure, and is always ready to try again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the past few seasons, our hard work has paid off. In 2022
      we were on the Winning Alliance at Canadian Pacific Regional 
      and qualified for World Championships. In 2023, we ranked 
      within the top 22% of FRC teams globally. By 2024, we climbed 
      into the top 10% worldwide. That same year, we also rose from 
      the top 22% of Canadian teams to an impressive 11%, marking a
      significant leap in our national performance. In 2025 we again 
      qualified for World Championships through the new Regional 
      Advancement System that rewarded our event performance and 
      awards

    <h3>FTC Teams</h3>
    <p>
      In 2019, the Alberta Tech Alliance Association (ATAA) launched its
      first-ever FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) teams, designed to engage
      students in grades 7 to 12. FTC offers a hands-on robotics experience
      using smaller robots on a 12-by-12-foot playing field, creating an
      accessible and exciting introduction to competitive robotics. The program is stand alone 
      or can serve as a stepping stone to FIRST Robotics Competition 
      (FRC), allowing younger students to build foundational STEM
      and teamwork skills. Today, our FTC program includes four dynamic
      teams: HyperDroid #10015, Crazy Artificial Intelligence #16596,
      Uncivilized Mecha Monkeys #23468, and Tech Titans #23684. Our FTC teams have earned numerous awards and
      have qualified for World Championships multiple times.

    <h3>FLL Teams</h3>
    <p>
      The Alberta Tech Alliance Association (ATAA) also supports three FIRST
      LEGO League (FLL) teams for elementary school students: Fire Breathing
      Rubber Duckies #13487, BOB Bots #58560, and The Creators #62273. FLL is
      the most accessible of the FIRST robotics programs, using LEGO Spike
      Prime robot kits on a tabletop field to introduce young students to the
      fundamentals of engineering, problem-solving, and teamwork in a fun and
      approachable way.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the 2024 season, our FLL teams achieved outstanding success —
      earning awards such as the Core Values Award, Coach of the Year, and
      the Southern Alberta Inspire Award. Their hard work and creativity also
      earned them spots at both the Southern Alberta Championships and the
      Alberta Provincial Championships, showcasing the strength of our
      youngest innovators.
