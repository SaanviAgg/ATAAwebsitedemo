  <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
  <div class="about-section">
    <p><strong>About Us:</strong> At FORGE Robotics, FRC Team 4421, our students are driven by the core values of FIRST
      — innovation, teamwork, and a commitment to learning. Both on and off the field, we strive to grow as individuals
      and as a team, empowering each other to think creatively, act with integrity, and lead with purpose.</p>

    <p>Forge Robotics provides students with the opportunity to explore science, technology, engineering, and math
      (STEM) in meaningful, hands-on ways throughout the year. Our team is made up of dedicated, skilled, and passionate
      members who push themselves and one another to continually improve. We believe that true innovation comes from a
      mindset of resilience — one that embraces challenges, learns from failure, and is always ready to try again.</p>

    <p>Over the past few seasons, our hard work has paid off. In 2022 we were on the Winning Alliance at Canadian
      Pacific Regional and qualified for World Championships. In 2023, we ranked within the top 22% of FRC teams
      globally. By 2024, we climbed into the top 10% worldwide. That same year, we also rose from the top 22% of
      Canadian teams to an impressive 11%, marking a significant leap in our national performance. In 2025 we again
      qualified for World Championships through the new Regional Advancement System that rewarded our event performance
      and awards.</p>

    <p><strong>Beyond:</strong> Beyond robotics, we focus on teamwork, leadership, and giving back—mentoring younger
      teams and helping grow Calgary’s STEM community. FORGE 4421 is proud to unite young innovators from across the
      city, building not just robots, but future leaders.</p>
